# Development portfolio site 

Hi, I'm Sophie, I'm a full stack developer. This is the repository of my portfolio website. 

It includes links to my deployed projects, CV and contact details, an overview of my skills, and a summary of my background.

## About Sophie

I love solving problems and building solutions with efficient, scalable, maintainable code. 

With a background in academic research (philosophy and cognitive science), I'm a lifelong learner. I bring the experience of systematic thinking across a variety of problem domains, and the ability to communicate complex concepts to my web development work. 

I'm interested in building applications that make abstract information easier to understand and navigate, and which facilitate effective decision making.

## Main languages / frameworks:
### JavaScript | PHP | React/Redux | Laravel | HTML5 | CSS 

I'm currently available for work/collaboration: send me an [email](mailto:sophie.stammers@gmail.com).
